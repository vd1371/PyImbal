# PyImbalReg
### Pre-processing technics for imbalanced datasets in regression modelling.
---
### Dealing with imbalanced datasets for regression modelling
Consider these pre-processing technics for solving possible future issues with these technics.

- RandomOversampling (RO)
- GaussianNoise and Undersampling (GN)
- WEighted Relevance-based Combination Strategy (WERCS)
---
## How to use? (2 Minutes read)
1. Pass your data as a pandas dataframe to any of these technics
2. Define a releavnce function that maps the output variable to [0, 1] (The higher this value the rarer the samples)
3. Set a threshold for flagging the samples: rare and normal
4. Set model-specific parameters
5. get() a new dataset with new samples
---
## Installation
```python
## Pypi version
pip install PyImbalReg

## GitHub version
pip install git+https://github.com/vd1371/PyImbalReg.git
```
---
## Example

```python
# importing PyImbalReg
import PyImbalReg as pir

# importing the data
from seaborn import load_dataset
data = load_dataset('dots')

ro = pir.RandomOversampling(data,               # Passing the data
							rel_func = None,    # Default relevance function will be used
							threshold = 0.7,    # Set the threshold
							o_percentage = 5    # ( o_percentage - 1 ) x n_rare_samples will be added 
							)
new_data = ro.get()
```
